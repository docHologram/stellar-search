# Create the Angular App Using Angular CLI

Even if you have never developed with Angular before, this is so simple, you'll barf.

In the directory where you want to store Stellar Search, open a command prompt:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This installs the Angular CLI to your local machine.

```
ng new stellar-search
```

This creates your app and installs all of it's npm package dependencies.

Good job! Wanna make sure? Run it:

```
cd stellar-search
ng serve
```

Now get some coffee and meet me at the next step, Creating Components.
